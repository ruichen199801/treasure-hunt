Users can browse listings in different categories such as cars, furniture, electronics, books, apparel, and more. Additionally, they can browse nearby listings on a map, making it easy to find local listings, and search listings by keyword, category, distance, date, and price.

As a buyer, users can communicate with the seller via validated student email for items they are interested in. They can also save listings to revisit them later.

As a seller, users can specify the details of the item for sale and upload up to 10 pictures in any format. They can manage their listings, including editing and deleting them.
